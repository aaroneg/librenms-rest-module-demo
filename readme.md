# netbox-rest-module demo

## Important
This set of scripts assumes the following things are true:
- You have a blank netbox install with just an admin user after following the install docs
- You have created a read/write API key on this blank install
- You understand that you absolutely shouldn't blindly run these scripts against your production netbox server if you already have one.

This is meant to show the process of taking a netbox install from zero to a reasonable demo state. It was created working against a blank netbox install version 2.10.3.
